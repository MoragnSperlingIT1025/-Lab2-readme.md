# Data Representation

##  Data Representation: Numeric Conversions
    
    Decimal is the common number practice that we use that has a base 10. 
    Binary is a number systemt that is commonly use in computer         
    programming that has a base 2. Hexidemical is used in computer 
    programming also usually used to express color. It has base 16 numbers. 
    
##  Data Representation: Hexadecimal Color Representation 
   
   #ff016b is a hexadeciaml used to represent vivid pink. 
     
     This color would be problematic because of the vividness would be hard to contrast with 
     the background and would be hard for people to see with visual impairments. Companies try
     have color constrast to have maximum recognizability. Things that can help this is font 
     size, contrast in the body text. You can also tweak the contrast ratio from 4.5:1 to 7:1
     .
## Software 
    
    Operating systems software has the essential function of managing the hardware 
    resouces of the computer, providing the user-interface compnents, and providing 
    a platform fro software developers to write applications. And example would be
    Microsoft's Windows.
    
    Application Software is software that is used for a goal of purpose. 
    An example would be Microsoft Word. You would use this to write papaer.
    
    Utility software that allows you to fix of modify your computer in some way.
    An example would be antivirus software. 
    
    ERP is short for enterprise resouce planning is a software that was 
    developed to bring together an entire organization in one software application. 
    Or ERP is a software appliaction utilizing a central ddatabase that is implemented throughpit the 
    entire organization. An example of this would be Salesforce.
    
    Virtualization is a mechanism used to help with memory with software. Many organizations deploy many servers, and with this problem
    there is huga demand for storage and processing. Virtualization relieas on software to simulate hardware functionality and create
    a vitrual computer system. 
    
     Virtualization is software that makes computing environments independent of physical infrastructure, while cloud computing is a          service that delivers shared computing resources on demand via the Internet. 
     
 # Virtualization
 
 What types of problems are solved with virtualization?
    
    Virtualization’s widespread applicability helped reduce vendor lock-in and made it the foundation of cloud computing. 

What role does hypervisor play in virtualization?
    
    Hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual 
    environments—the things that need those resources. Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system (like on a laptop) or be           installed directly onto hardware (like a server), which is how most enterprises virtualize. Hypervisors take your physical resources     and divide them up so that virtual environments can use them.
    
# Python

    What is meant by the "pseudo-code nature of Python?"
    
    Python is a simple computing language. Reading Python code is like reading english, and this pseudo-code is one of the good 
    things about the Python language. 
    
    What is an interpreted language vs. a compiled language?
    
    The difference is compiled language that is put through a complier produces a program written in asssembly language while               interpreted language has an interpreter produces a result from a program.
