# Executive Summary

    The objectives of this unit is to explain data representation and practice of converting decimal binary and hexadecimal,
    define software types and pratice working and virtualization and Python and explore careers in IT. 


# Data Representation

##  Data Representation: Numeric Conversions
    
    Decimal is the common number practice that we use that has a base 10. 
    Binary is a number systemt that is commonly use in computer         
    programming that has a base 2. Hexidemical is used in computer 
    programming also usually used to express color. It has base 16 numbers. 
    
##  Data Representation: Hexadecimal Color Representation 
   
   #ff016b is a hexadeciaml used to represent vivid pink. 
     
     This color would be problematic because of the vividness would be hard to contrast with 
     the background and would be hard for people to see with visual impairments. Companies try
     have color constrast to have maximum recognizability. Things that can help this is font 
     size, contrast in the body text. You can also tweak the contrast ratio from 4.5:1 to 7:1
     .
## Software 
    
    Operating systems software has the essential function of managing the hardware 
    resouces of the computer, providing the user-interface compnents, and providing 
    a platform fro software developers to write applications. And example would be
    Microsoft's Windows.
    
    Application Software is software that is used for a goal of purpose. 
    An example would be Microsoft Word. You would use this to write papaer.
    
    Utility software that allows you to fix of modify your computer in some way.
    An example would be antivirus software. 
    
    ERP is short for enterprise resouce planning is a software that was 
    developed to bring together an entire organization in one software application. 
    Or ERP is a software appliaction utilizing a central ddatabase that is implemented throughpit the 
    entire organization. An example of this would be Salesforce.
    
    Virtualization is a mechanism used to help with memory with software. Many organizations deploy many servers, and with this problem
    there is huga demand for storage and processing. Virtualization relieas on software to simulate hardware functionality and create
    a vitrual computer system. 
    
     Virtualization is software that makes computing environments independent of physical infrastructure, while cloud computing is a          service that delivers shared computing resources on demand via the Internet. 
     
 # Virtualization
 
 What types of problems are solved with virtualization?
    
    Virtualization’s widespread applicability helped reduce vendor lock-in and made it the foundation of cloud computing. 

What role does hypervisor play in virtualization?
    
    Hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual 
    environments—the things that need those resources. Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system (like on a laptop) or be           installed directly onto hardware (like a server), which is how most enterprises virtualize. Hypervisors take your physical resources     and divide them up so that virtual environments can use them.
    
# Python

    What is meant by the "pseudo-code nature of Python?"
    
    Python is a simple computing language. Reading Python code is like reading english, and this pseudo-code is one of the good 
    things about the Python language. 
    
    What is an interpreted language vs. a compiled language?
    
    The difference is compiled language that is put through a complier produces a program written in asssembly language while               interpreted language has an interpreter produces a result from a program. 
    
# Career Exploration 
    I registered for this account and it is a resource for Tri-C students to find jobs and interships. I also look up my career of 
    interest of data analytics under the BLS and found out that this field is highly lucrative and fast growing
   
## Certifications 
     
     CompTia- is an entry level certification this is an certification used to show troubleshooting and problem-solving with computers.
     Technicians understand a wide variety of issues ranging from networking and operating systems to mobile devices and security.
     
     Cisco- The CCENT certification validates the skills required for entry-level network support positions, the starting point for many      successful careers in networking.
     
     CISSP-This certification is used for cyber security and has one the specializes in healthcare.
     
     Data Anlytics would be the certificate of most interest to me. I am working towrds this certification now and I should be done by        the end of the year. 
   
## Co-ops / Internships
    
    Currently enrolled at Cuyahoga Community College
    Completed 12 credit hours of college coursework (includes transfer credits) with at least two courses related to your major field
    GPA of 2.75 or higher
    
    Benefits- Up to three credits per semester
            - Hand-on learning
            - Real life job opportunties 
            - Compensation
            
## Industry Associations / Student Organizations


    CCDC stands for Collegiate Cyber Defense competition this organization is designed to build a meaningful mechanism 
    by which institutions of higher education may evaluate. Provide an educational venue in which students are able to apply theory
    and practical skils they have learned in their course work, and many more. 


    
# Conclusion

    This unit has very valuable information for a future IT professional that is trying to build their fundamental foundation of             knowlodge. In this unit I learned how to convert to binary to decimal from decimal to binary. I learned about virtualization 
    and its uses. I also learned about the many opportunties in IT throught our College Central site.
